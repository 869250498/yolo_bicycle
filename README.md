# YOLO_Bicycle

This work is our scientific research.

## Problem

Our work is hard to apply to complex scene.

Refer to [this](https://www.learnopencv.com/object-tracking-using-opencv-cpp-python/) to learn more about tracker API in opencv.

## Environment

`NOTE`:pip or pip3 depend on your environment, and you can install tensorflow through anaconda, referring to [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)

* Tensorflow installation

  pip3 install tensorflow, refer to [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#installing_with_native_pip) for more details.

* Opncv and opencv-contrib installation

  pip3 install opencv-contrib-python, refer to [this](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).

  Learn more about the difference bewteen opencv and opencv-contrib, refer to [this](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib). 

* Darknet installation
